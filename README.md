# my-webpage
Second time lucky
Keeping it simple this time with just a single branch (main) to push commits :)
Update: following the tutorial on OliverJam.es on the complete guide to making web pages. Trying to combine that with learning how to use git. Running into issues almost every hour. CSS file won't load. Error message found in the "console panel" of the dev tools on Chrome.
